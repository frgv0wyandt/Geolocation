# Geolocation Example

This example demonstrates how to use geolocation services in a web application to find the user's location and display it on a map.

## Usage

Replace `API_KEY` in the Google Maps API script tag with your own Google Cloud Platform key.  
The application will attempt to determine your geolocation and display your coordinates along with a map showing your location.
